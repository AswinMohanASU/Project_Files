# FPGA Implementation of 128 bit AES Encryption and Decryption Algorithm                                       
•	Implemented 128 bit AES encryption and decryption algorithm using Symphony Model Compiler.   
•	Optimized the design at Architectural level by utilizing parallelism, loop unrolling and pipelining thereby improvising throughput.  
•	Observed a 3x performance improvement in terms of speed when simulated against its software counterpart.
